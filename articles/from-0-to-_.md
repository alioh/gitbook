## Getting started

### Free Code Camp
So you wanna learn to code... but where to start?

This is a big topic. If javascript (JS) is where you wanna be I would checkout [Free Code Camp(FCC)](https://www.freecodecamp.com/). Free code camp is probably my favorite thing on the internet!

Getting stuck on a challenge? Here is a link to my solutions.... but shh, you didn't get this from me. ;)

### React?
I would recomend Ember for new devs since it has most of the kinks for starting a new project already worked out. However, if you are striving for RDD (Resume Driven Development) and are convinced React is what the cool kids are up to, I highly recomend diving into and learning how all the moving parts work. For this, I have not come accross a better resource than the following:

> [Cory House: Building a JavaScript Development Environment](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/javascript-development-environment)

Cory House walks you through the buzzwords and also the decision process of deciding which buzzwords are important / valuable. In the end you will know every moving part of a TDD, React, Redux environment. #rockStar!!!

#### React + Corber

> [Github: React Sling Shot + corber.io](http://joshuamccall.com/articles/react_sling_shot_corber.html)

Whether it's Emberjs, React, Vuejs... I want to tackle as much ground as possible. This project shows how to integrate your shiny new react dev environment into a corber.io project to target web as well as native/hybrid apps!!!
