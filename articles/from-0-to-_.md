# From 0 to _
## Getting started
So you wanna learn to code... but where to start?

This is a big topic. If javascript (JS) is where you wanna be I would checkout ember.js! The community, the resources and the framework make it easier for beginners to get things done. To see what I mean, watch [@ladyleet's](https://twitter.com/ladyleet) video and then read through her write up.

I would suggest getting a base before jumping into ember, like ladyleet did with her 2 week HTML/CSS/JS training, head over to freecodecamp to start you bootcamp! Don't worry about mastering ember (or anything just yet), as you work through the challenges you will get a feel for what's your niche.
