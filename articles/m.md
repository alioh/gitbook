### Tips:

Please be ready to code and answer problem solving questions. Tech screens can lean toward CS fundamentals. You could get asked a diverse range of questions (data structures, link list, binary trees and so forth).

The screens aren’t necessarily focused towards skills listed in the job description. When coding the screener will typically have you use the programming language that you are most comfortable with.  The better candidates we see tend to:  diagram the problem, ask clarifying questions before trying to solve or write code, and check your work without being prompted.  Think about external factor that you should consider in the problem solving.

Also, be able to talk about how you help and impact your team and the end product and the end customer.  How you can understand the small details out to the big picture of the overarching goals of the business and being customer focused/obsessed.

Use the product and feel comfortable with it.  You may want to put together some questions to ask your interviewer in advance as well about the product to show you have done your homework and you are invested.  Always good to demonstrate your passion and fore thought in preparing questions and doing your homework on the company and product that you are be interviewed around.  I would review the links that I sent you to get up to date.

Also, to help you prepare you mind around the new leadership and direction of Microsoft, I recommend reading through this article and a letter that Satya Nadella sent to all Microsoft Employees in July of 2014.  This will help you get a good idea of our vision as a company and our future direction:

Satya Nadella's Microsoft is a very different animal, unafraid to use any technology if it gets the job done.
