#Workiva

A while back I got to sit in on a product talk at Workiva. The main focus was on the tech, the culture and how Workiva was crafting the next iteration of their products. 

>As I sat there eating my homemade ice cream and warm cookies in a deliciously messy ice cream sandwich, I thought "oh crap, I should probably take notes". Then the slide flashed on the wall [Workiva is on Github!](https://workiva.github.io/), phew... now back to my ice cream.
