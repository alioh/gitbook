## The Two Pillars of JavaScript Pt 2
(Functional Programming)
Dec 12, 2014

How to Stop Micromanaging Everything


"JavaScript is one of the most important programming languages of all time, not simply because of its popularity, but because it popularized two features which are extremely important for the evolution of programming:
Prototypal Inheritance (objects without classes, and prototype delegation, aka OLOO — Objects Linking to Other Objects), and
Functional Programming (enabled by lambdas with closure)"


"The only way we’ll be able to keep up with the exponentially increasing complexity will be to decrease the complexity of understanding programs. To maintain the goliath apps of tomorrow, we must learn to build more expressive code. We must learn to write programs that are easier to reason about, debug, create, analyze, and understand.

'Procedural programming and OOP are not going to get us where we need to go by themselves.'"


"The venerable master Qc Na was walking with his student, Anton. Hoping to prompt the master into a discussion, Anton said “Master, I have heard that objects are a very good thing — is this true?” Qc Na looked pityingly at his student and replied, “Foolish pupil — objects are merely a poor man’s closures.”

Chastised, Anton took his leave from his master and returned to his cell, intent on studying closures. He carefully read the entire “Lambda: The Ultimate…” series of papers and its cousins, and implemented a small Scheme interpreter with a closure-based object system. He learned much, and looked forward to informing his master of his progress.

On his next walk with Qc Na, Anton attempted to impress his master by saying “Master, I have diligently studied the matter, and now understand that objects are truly a poor man’s closures.” Qc Na responded by hitting Anton with his stick, saying “When will you learn? Closures are a poor man’s object.” At that moment, Anton became enlightened.
~ Anton van Straaten"

## The Two Pillars of JavaScript
Oct 21, 2014

Part 1: How to Escape the 7th Circle of Hell
* Prototypal Inheritance (objects without classes, and prototype delegation, aka OLOO — Objects Linking to Other Objects), and
* Functional Programming (enabled by lambdas with closure)
"... because JavaScript is pretty good at letting you code poorly if you don’t bother to learn it properly.
This is actually a feature, because it makes it really easy to pick up JavaScript and start doing useful things with it, but that phase of your development as a JavaScript programmer should last no more than a year.
If you haven’t yet, it’s time to level up."

"...Classical deep inheritance trees always bothered me, especially in the context of web development where business needs are often a moving target."


"Other good alternatives include making better use of JavaScript modules as an alternative to inheritance (I recommend npm and ES6 modules with Browserify or WebPack), or simply cloning objects by copying properties from a source object to a new object (e.g. `Object.assign()`, `$.extend()`, `_.extend()`, etc…)."

"You never need classes in JavaScript, and I have never seen a situation where class is a better approach than the alternatives."

"Another common argument that programmers use is that it should be up to them how they express themselves, as if code style rises to the level of art or fashion. This argument is a purely emotional and irrational:
Your code isn’t the product of your self expression any more than a painter’s paintbrush is the product of their self expression. Code is the tool. The program is the product."

## Fighting Poverty in Schools
Sep 28, 2014 

How we act today will make or break our future

"Even if you can’t imagine right now that your kid might need to know how to program, I have some information you might want to pay attention to:

**Researchers believe that in just 2 decades about 45% of today’s jobs will be replaced by code or robots.*** Being deeply entrenched in Silicon Valley startup culture and knowing the technology that’s right around the corner, I believe they’re underestimating.

~ this is not science fiction ~"

"At several of my recent jobs, I’ve been tasked to hire developers who are ready to start contributing productively to applications that serve millions of monthly users. In case you’ve never tried to do this before, it’s very hard. "

## If Your Head Isnt In the Clouds Chances Are Youre Not Soaring
#### Eric Elliott in The Backer Army
Jul 16, 2014

"Don’t make my mistake. Think of the seven people you love most in the world. For the next seven days, start each morning with a short letter. Reach out to one of your most cherished loved ones. Share this article and add a tale or two about the trouble you got up to when you were a little less wise and a little less aware of what you couldn’t (or shouldn’t) do. Tell them how much you love them. Believe me, it would mean the world to them."

## Fighting Poverty with Code
Jul 8, 2014 

"Did you know it costs more money to let somebody sleep on the street than it costs to give them homes for free?"

"Because JavaScript is the only programming language supported by every modern browser, the entire web is dependent on it, making it the most widely used programming language in the world — and it’s still growing faster than any other programming language. There’s just one problem: There aren’t enough JavaScript developers to keep up with demand."

"Demand for software developers is so high that most of the top companies have an always hiring policy for developers; they hire as quickly as they can find qualified candidates, and when that’s not fast enough, they actively recruit candidates from other countries or outsource work to India."

"If you want to help, you can purchase a course bundle (you can give them as gifts or use them yourself. If you’re not sure who to give it to, we can refer you to a school or training program).
Another great way to help is to share this article with your friends."
