# What's in a theme?

## Whats in a Theme?
When someone googles you, what comes up? The second your site comes up (or doesn't), first impressions are formed.
If you have a business, this impression could be the difference between building a relationship or sending someone the opposite way.

## How do I know what's important?
Simply having a domain builds credibility but there's a couple things you can do to make sure your site is a great fist impression.

### UX
User Experience - this is hard to pin down but overall, how is the experience of viewing/using your site for the first time?

### Responsive
It is hard to get a site to not look great on a laptop or desktop, but what happens when people google you from their phone?
Having your content adapt to screen size not only makes your site look better but helps with functionality as well.

### Navigation and 404s
