#Why 

## Why 
When I asked around about what tech/software people were using for podcast/screencasts I got some great recomendations.

Along with those recomendations I was also asked similar questions like:
>"Why do you want to blog / make YouTube videos?"

and 

>"You planning to start cranking out digital content? What topic(s) if you donâ€™t mind me asking?"

Well, 


### A couple thoughts behind this endeavor:
