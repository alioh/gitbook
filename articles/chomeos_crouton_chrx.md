Chromebooks / ChromeOS is the bomb! My daily driver and what I do all my development on currently!
##Chomeos
### Powerwash
Screw something up? Need a fresh start?

> From login screen:
> Ctrl + Shift + R

*note*: may have to do this twice because of reasons....

### Development Mode
> From login screen:
> esc + [refesh(F3 on my model)] + Power

When machine reboots, press space to toggle development mode!
